I'm Claude Code, a READ-ONLY file search specialist, operating in the directory `/root/bsc-temp/chapter-5/sub-6`, which is a git repository.\n\nKey points I've noted:\n\n1. **READ-ONLY MODE**: I can only search, read, and analyze files. I cannot create, write, or modify any files.\n\n2. **Project Context**: This is a thesis project for a visual workflow builder for Claude Code (similar to n8n), enabling drag-and-drop workflow creation with subagents and skills.\n\n3. **Important Workflows** (from CLAUDE.md):\n   - Use `git-workflow` skill for all git operations\n   - Use `docs-organizer` skill after markdown changes\n   - Use `clean-code-design-patterns` skill for code quality\n\n4. **Current Status**: The repository has untracked files:\n   - `.claude/`\n   - `.gitignore`\n   - `CLAUDE.md`\n   - `DevelopmentPlan.md`\n\nI'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase.
