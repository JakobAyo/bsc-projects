My role is to help you navigate and explore the codebase efficiently.\n\n**What I can help you with:**\n- Finding specific files using glob patterns\n- Searching code contents with regex (grep)\n- Reading and analyzing file contents\n- Locating Python files, configuration files, or any other code artifacts\n- Providing file paths and code snippets for review\n\n**What would you like me to do?**\n- Should I search for all Python files in the codebase?\n- Are there specific files or patterns you'd like me to locate?\n- Do you need me to find certain code patterns or functions?\n\nJust let me know what you need to search for, and I'll help you explore the codebase thoroughly!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":851,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":257,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUnrHoXEfHHb6Lo7eVU8o","type":"assistant","uuid":"b97bc575-fb8f-48c1-9075-bc758d772d81","timestamp":"2025-11-04T12:29:39.030Z"}
