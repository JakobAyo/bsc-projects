Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited*)\n\n*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n\nTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n2. When should the skill be used?\n3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"2c4518f7-ca73-4cfd-b335-551d6ebfafc6","timestamp":"2025-11-06T09:51:41.938Z"}

Use when users need to create timelines, track writing progress, organize research phases, or structure their thesis work. Particularly valuable for CS/engineering theses with implementation and experimental components. Handles deadline-driven planning with workday calculations (Monday-Friday schedules).\n---\n\n# Bachelor Thesis Planner\n\n## Overview\n\nPlan, organize, and track Bachelor thesis projects from start to deadline. Generate detailed weekly timelines, track writing progress against page targets, and manage the complete thesis lifecycle including research, implementation, experimentation, and writing phases.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nActivate this skill when users request:\n- \"Help me plan my Bachelor thesis\"\n- \"Create a timeline for my thesis (deadline: [date])\"\n- \"Track my thesis progress\"\n- \"I need to write [X] pages by [date]\"\n- \"Plan my thesis research and writing schedule\"\n- \"How am I doing on my thesis? I've written [X] pages\"\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n### 1. Timeline Generation\n\nGenerate comprehensive weekly timelines from current date to deadline with automatic workday calculation (Monday-Friday only).\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\npython scripts/generate_timeline.py \\\n  --deadline 2025-01-15 \\\n  --pages 50 \\\n  --hours-per-day 4.5 \\\n  --output timeline.md\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `--deadline`: Thesis submission deadline (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- `--pages`: Target page count (default: 50)\n- `--hours-per-day`: Available work hours per workday (default: 4.5)\n- `--phases`: Custom phase names (optional)\n- `--output`: Output file path (optional, prints to stdout if omitted)\n\n**Output includes:**\n- Week-by-week breakdown with dates\n- Current thesis phase (Research, Implementation, Writing, Revision)\n- Workdays and hours available per week\n- Target pages per week with cumulative tracking\n- Task placeholders in format: `- [ ] TASK 📅 YYYY-MM-DD`\n\n**Default phases:**\n1. Research & Literature Review\n2. Experimentation & Implementation\n3. Writing & Analysis\n4. Revision & Finalization\n\nTo customize phases, use:\n```bash\n--phases \"Phase 1 Name\" \"Phase 2 Name\" \"Phase 3 Name\"\n```\n\n### 2. Progress Tracking\n\nTrack actual progress against planned timeline and calculate required pace adjustments.\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\npython scripts/track_progress.py \\\n  --pages-completed 25 \\\n  --total-pages 50 \\\n  --deadline 2025-01-15 \\\n  --hours-per-day 4.5 \\\n  --output progress_report.md\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `--pages-completed`: Pages written so far\n- `--total-pages`: Target page count (default: 50)\n- `--deadline`: Thesis submission deadline (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- `--hours-per-day`: Available work hours per workday (default: 4.5)\n- `--output`: Output file path (optional)\n\n**Output includes:**\n- Progress percentage and status assessment\n- Pages remaining and time remaining\n- Required pages per day/hour to finish on time\n- Comparison to expected linear progress\n- Status: \"On Track\", \"Slightly Behind\", \"Behind Schedule\", or \"Significantly Behind\"\n- Actionable recommendations based on status\n\n### 3. Thesis Structure Guidance\n\nRefer to `references/thesis_structure_template.md` for:\n- Complete CS thesis structure (50+ pages)\n- Chapter-by-chapter page recommendations\n- Content guidelines for each section\n- Academic writing tips and common pitfalls\n- Citation and formatting guidance\n\n**To use:**\n```bash\ncat references/thesis_structure_template.md\n```\n\nLoad this reference when users ask:\n- \"How should I structure my thesis?\"\n- \"How many pages for each chapter?\"\n- \"What goes in the methodology section?\"\n- \"Help me outline my thesis\"\n\n### 4. Weekly Planning Templates\n\nUse `references/weekly_checklist.md` for weekly planning sessions:\n- Complete weekly checklist template\n- Daily task breakdown (Monday-Friday)\n- Progress tracking checkboxes\n- Time management guidelines\n- Red flags and warning signs\n\n**To use:**\nCopy the template and customize for each week:\n```bash\ncat references/weekly_checklist.md\n```\n\n### 5. Daily Work Logs\n\nUse `assets/daily_log_template.md` for daily tracking:\n- Daily goals and task lists\n- Hours worked and accomplishments\n- Notes, insights, and blockers\n- Next day planning\n\n**To use:**\nCopy template for each workday:\n```bash\ncp assets/daily_log_template.md daily_log_[DATE].md\n```\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n### Initial Planning Session\n\nWhen a user requests thesis planning:\n\n1. **Gather requirements:**\n   - Deadline date\n   - Target page count\n   - Daily available hours (Monday-Friday)\n   - Thesis topic/field\n   - Current outline status\n\n2. **Generate timeline:**\n   ```bash\n   python scripts/generate_timeline.py \\\n     --deadline [USER_DEADLINE] \\\n     --pages [TARGET_PAGES] \\\n     --hours-per-day [DAILY_HOURS] \\\n     --output thesis_timeline.md\n   ```\n\n3. **Customize timeline:**\n   - Open generated `thesis_timeline.md`\n   - Replace `TASK_PLACEHOLDER` entries with specific tasks based on:\n     - User's thesis outline\n     - Current phase (research/implementation/writing)\n     - `references/thesis_structure_template.md` chapter breakdown\n\n4. **Provide structure guidance:**\n   - Share relevant sections from `references/thesis_structure_template.md`\n   - Help break down chapters into weekly targets\n\n### Weekly Check-ins\n\nWhen user reports progress:\n\n1. **Run progress tracker:**\n   ```bash\n   python scripts/track_progress.py \\\n     --pages-completed [CURRENT_PAGES] \\\n     --deadline [USER_DEADLINE] \\\n     --total-pages [TARGET_PAGES] \\\n     --hours-per-day [DAILY_HOURS]\n   ```\n\n2. **Review status:**\n   - Analyze progress report output\n   - Discuss recommendations if behind schedule\n   - Adjust timeline if needed\n\n3. **Plan next week:**\n   - Copy `references/weekly_checklist.md` template\n   - Fill in specific tasks for upcoming week\n   - Set realistic page targets based on progress tracker\n\n### Phase Transitions\n\nWhen moving between thesis phases:\n\n1. **Review completed phase:**\n   - Check off completed tasks\n   - Document lessons learned\n\n2. **Prepare next phase:**\n   - Regenerate timeline if needed (updated `--phases` parameter)\n   - Update weekly focus in checklist\n   - Adjust daily task types (research → writing → revision)\n\n## Task Format Convention\n\nAll tasks in timelines and checklists use this format:\n```\n- [ ] TASK_DESCRIPTION 📅 YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\n- [ ] Read 3 papers on neural networks 📅 2025-11-08\n- [ ] Implement baseline model 📅 2025-11-09\n- [ ] Write methodology section draft 📅 2025-11-10\n```\n\nWhen customizing timelines, replace `TASK_PLACEHOLDER` with specific, actionable tasks following this format.\n\n## Time Management Guidelines\n\n### Typical 4-5 Hour Workday Structure\n\n**Morning Block (2-2.5 hours):**\n- Deep work: writing, coding, analysis\n- Most challenging tasks\n- Minimize distractions\n\n**Break (15-30 minutes)**\n\n**Afternoon Block (2-2.5 hours):**\n- Research, reading, literature review\n- Experiments, testing, data collection\n- Revision and editing\n\n### Weekly Time Distribution (20-25 hours)\n\n| Activity | Hours/Week | Percentage |\n|----------|------------|------------|\n| Writing | 8-10 | 40% |\n| Research/Reading | 4-5 | 20% |\n| Implementation/Experiments | 6-8 | 30% |\n| Revision/Admin | 2-2 | 10% |\n\nAdjust based on current phase:\n- **Research phase:** 50% research, 30% writing, 20% implementation\n- **Implementation phase:** 50% implementation, 30% writing, 20% research\n- **Writing phase:** 70% writing, 20% revision, 10% research\n- **Revision phase:** 80% revision, 20% final writing\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\n### Scenario: User significantly behind schedule\n\n**When progress tracker shows \"Significantly Behind\":**\n\n1. Run the progress tracker to quantify the gap\n2. Discuss realistic options:\n   - Increase daily hours (if possible)\n   - Simplify scope (reduce experimental work)\n   - Prioritize essential sections\n   - Discuss with thesis advisor\n3. Create recovery plan:\n   - Regenerate timeline with adjusted parameters\n   - Focus on high-value sections first\n   - Cut non-essential content\n\n### Scenario: User ahead of schedule\n\n**When progress tracker shows \"On Track\" with buffer:**\n\n1. Celebrate the progress\n2. Suggest using buffer time for:\n   - More thorough literature review\n   - Additional experiments/features\n   - Earlier revision passes\n   - Building presentation materials\n3. Consider moving deadline internally earlier for stress reduction\n\n### Scenario: User needs to restructure thesis\n\n**When outline changes significantly:**\n\n1. Review `references/thesis_structure_template.md` together\n2. Create new chapter breakdown with page targets\n3. Regenerate timeline if deadline/pages changed\n4. Update weekly tasks to match new structure\n5. Adjust progress tracking baseline\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Generate timeline early:** Create the timeline at project start, even if approximate\n2. **Track weekly:** Run progress tracker every Friday to catch issues early\n3. **Be realistic:** Use actual available hours, account for other commitments\n4. **Update regularly:** Regenerate timeline when circumstances change\n5. **Break down tasks:** Convert abstract goals (\"write chapter 3\") into concrete daily tasks\n6. **Use templates:** Copy daily/weekly templates consistently for habit formation\n7. **Review structure:** Consult thesis structure template when planning each chapter\n8. **Buffer time:** Plan to finish 3-5 days before actual deadline for emergency buffer\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Timeline seems too aggressive:**\n- Reduce `--hours-per-day` to realistic value\n- Increase `--pages` estimate if current target too ambitious\n- Check if deadline is correct\n\n**Tasks not fitting in weekly schedule:**\n- Break tasks into smaller units\n- Prioritize and move non-essential tasks\n- Consider if scope is too large\n\n**Progress tracker showing unexpected status:**\n- Verify `--pages-completed` count is accurate\n- Check page counting methodology (full pages? half pages?)\n- Ensure deadline date is correct\n\n**Generated timeline has wrong phase names:**\n- Use `--phases` parameter to customize phase names\n- Order phases chronologically\n- Number of phases is flexible (3-5 recommended)\n\n## Resources Summary\n\n**Scripts:**\n- `scripts/generate_timeline.py` - Generate weekly timeline with workday calculations\n- `scripts/track_progress.py` - Calculate progress metrics and status assessment\n\n**References:**\n- `references/thesis_structure_template.md` - Complete CS thesis structure guide (50+ pages)\n- `references/weekly_checklist.md` - Weekly planning template with time management tips\n\n**Assets:**\n- `assets/daily_log_template.md` - Daily work log template for tracking daily progress\n\nAll scripts support `--help` flag for detailed usage information.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1375,"cache_read_input_tokens":36060,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1375,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUrSB24pXCn5fPVy6PdxV","type":"assistant","uuid":"aa8c87a1-8ef3-406c-9b55-7b2b207a95fd","timestamp":"2025-11-06T09:56:34.117Z"}

Use when users need to create timelines, track writing progress, organize research phases, or structure their thesis work. Particularly valuable for CS/engineering theses with implementation and experimental components. Handles deadline-driven planning with workday calculations (Monday-Friday schedules).\n---\n\n# Bachelor Thesis Planner\n\n## Overview\n\nPlan, organize, and track Bachelor thesis projects from start to deadline. Generate detailed weekly timelines, track writing progress against page targets, and manage the complete thesis lifecycle including research, implementation, experimentation, and writing phases.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nActivate this skill when users request:\n- \"Help me plan my Bachelor thesis\"\n- \"Create a timeline for my thesis (deadline: [date])\"\n- \"Track my thesis progress\"\n- \"I need to write [X] pages by [date]\"\n- \"Plan my thesis research and writing schedule\"\n- \"How am I doing on my thesis? I've written [X] pages\"\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n### 1. Timeline Generation\n\nGenerate comprehensive weekly timelines from current date to deadline with automatic workday calculation (Monday-Friday only).\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\npython scripts/generate_timeline.py \\\n  --deadline 2025-01-15 \\\n  --pages 50 \\\n  --hours-per-day 4.5 \\\n  --output timeline.md\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `--deadline`: Thesis submission deadline (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- `--pages`: Target page count (default: 50)\n- `--hours-per-day`: Available work hours per workday (default: 4.5)\n- `--phases`: Custom phase names (optional)\n- `--output`: Output file path (optional, prints to stdout if omitted)\n\n**Output includes:**\n- Week-by-week breakdown with dates\n- Current thesis phase (Research, Implementation, Writing, Revision)\n- Workdays and hours available per week\n- Target pages per week with cumulative tracking\n- Task placeholders in format: `- [ ] TASK 📅 YYYY-MM-DD`\n\n**Default phases:**\n1. Research & Literature Review\n2. Experimentation & Implementation\n3. Writing & Analysis\n4. Revision & Finalization\n\nTo customize phases, use:\n```bash\n--phases \"Phase 1 Name\" \"Phase 2 Name\" \"Phase 3 Name\"\n```\n\n### 2. Progress Tracking\n\nTrack actual progress against planned timeline and calculate required pace adjustments.\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\npython scripts/track_progress.py \\\n  --pages-completed 25 \\\n  --total-pages 50 \\\n  --deadline 2025-01-15 \\\n  --hours-per-day 4.5 \\\n  --output progress_report.md\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `--pages-completed`: Pages written so far\n- `--total-pages`: Target page count (default: 50)\n- `--deadline`: Thesis submission deadline (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- `--hours-per-day`: Available work hours per workday (default: 4.5)\n- `--output`: Output file path (optional)\n\n**Output includes:**\n- Progress percentage and status assessment\n- Pages remaining and time remaining\n- Required pages per day/hour to finish on time\n- Comparison to expected linear progress\n- Status: \"On Track\", \"Slightly Behind\", \"Behind Schedule\", or \"Significantly Behind\"\n- Actionable recommendations based on status\n\n### 3. Thesis Structure Guidance\n\nRefer to `references/thesis_structure_template.md` for:\n- Complete CS thesis structure (50+ pages)\n- Chapter-by-chapter page recommendations\n- Content guidelines for each section\n- Academic writing tips and common pitfalls\n- Citation and formatting guidance\n\n**To use:**\n```bash\ncat references/thesis_structure_template.md\n```\n\nLoad this reference when users ask:\n- \"How should I structure my thesis?\"\n- \"How many pages for each chapter?\"\n- \"What goes in the methodology section?\"\n- \"Help me outline my thesis\"\n\n### 4. Weekly Planning Templates\n\nUse `references/weekly_checklist.md` for weekly planning sessions:\n- Complete weekly checklist template\n- Daily task breakdown (Monday-Friday)\n- Progress tracking checkboxes\n- Time management guidelines\n- Red flags and warning signs\n\n**To use:**\nCopy the template and customize for each week:\n```bash\ncat references/weekly_checklist.md\n```\n\n### 5. Daily Work Logs\n\nUse `assets/daily_log_template.md` for daily tracking:\n- Daily goals and task lists\n- Hours worked and accomplishments\n- Notes, insights, and blockers\n- Next day planning\n\n**To use:**\nCopy template for each workday:\n```bash\ncp assets/daily_log_template.md daily_log_[DATE].md\n```\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n### Initial Planning Session\n\nWhen a user requests thesis planning:\n\n1. **Gather requirements:**\n   - Deadline date\n   - Target page count\n   - Daily available hours (Monday-Friday)\n   - Thesis topic/field\n   - Current outline status\n\n2. **Generate timeline:**\n   ```bash\n   python scripts/generate_timeline.py \\\n     --deadline [USER_DEADLINE] \\\n     --pages [TARGET_PAGES] \\\n     --hours-per-day [DAILY_HOURS] \\\n     --output thesis_timeline.md\n   ```\n\n3. **Customize timeline:**\n   - Open generated `thesis_timeline.md`\n   - Replace `TASK_PLACEHOLDER` entries with specific tasks based on:\n     - User's thesis outline\n     - Current phase (research/implementation/writing)\n     - `references/thesis_structure_template.md` chapter breakdown\n\n4. **Provide structure guidance:**\n   - Share relevant sections from `references/thesis_structure_template.md`\n   - Help break down chapters into weekly targets\n\n### Weekly Check-ins\n\nWhen user reports progress:\n\n1. **Run progress tracker:**\n   ```bash\n   python scripts/track_progress.py \\\n     --pages-completed [CURRENT_PAGES] \\\n     --deadline [USER_DEADLINE] \\\n     --total-pages [TARGET_PAGES] \\\n     --hours-per-day [DAILY_HOURS]\n   ```\n\n2. **Review status:**\n   - Analyze progress report output\n   - Discuss recommendations if behind schedule\n   - Adjust timeline if needed\n\n3. **Plan next week:**\n   - Copy `references/weekly_checklist.md` template\n   - Fill in specific tasks for upcoming week\n   - Set realistic page targets based on progress tracker\n\n### Phase Transitions\n\nWhen moving between thesis phases:\n\n1. **Review completed phase:**\n   - Check off completed tasks\n   - Document lessons learned\n\n2. **Prepare next phase:**\n   - Regenerate timeline if needed (updated `--phases` parameter)\n   - Update weekly focus in checklist\n   - Adjust daily task types (research → writing → revision)\n\n## Task Format Convention\n\nAll tasks in timelines and checklists use this format:\n```\n- [ ] TASK_DESCRIPTION 📅 YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\n- [ ] Read 3 papers on neural networks 📅 2025-11-08\n- [ ] Implement baseline model 📅 2025-11-09\n- [ ] Write methodology section draft 📅 2025-11-10\n```\n\nWhen customizing timelines, replace `TASK_PLACEHOLDER` with specific, actionable tasks following this format.\n\n## Time Management Guidelines\n\n### Typical 4-5 Hour Workday Structure\n\n**Morning Block (2-2.5 hours):**\n- Deep work: writing, coding, analysis\n- Most challenging tasks\n- Minimize distractions\n\n**Break (15-30 minutes)**\n\n**Afternoon Block (2-2.5 hours):**\n- Research, reading, literature review\n- Experiments, testing, data collection\n- Revision and editing\n\n### Weekly Time Distribution (20-25 hours)\n\n| Activity | Hours/Week | Percentage |\n|----------|------------|------------|\n| Writing | 8-10 | 40% |\n| Research/Reading | 4-5 | 20% |\n| Implementation/Experiments | 6-8 | 30% |\n| Revision/Admin | 2-2 | 10% |\n\nAdjust based on current phase:\n- **Research phase:** 50% research, 30% writing, 20% implementation\n- **Implementation phase:** 50% implementation, 30% writing, 20% research\n- **Writing phase:** 70% writing, 20% revision, 10% research\n- **Revision phase:** 80% revision, 20% final writing\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\n### Scenario: User significantly behind schedule\n\n**When progress tracker shows \"Significantly Behind\":**\n\n1. Run the progress tracker to quantify the gap\n2. Discuss realistic options:\n   - Increase daily hours (if possible)\n   - Simplify scope (reduce experimental work)\n   - Prioritize essential sections\n   - Discuss with thesis advisor\n3. Create recovery plan:\n   - Regenerate timeline with adjusted parameters\n   - Focus on high-value sections first\n   - Cut non-essential content\n\n### Scenario: User ahead of schedule\n\n**When progress tracker shows \"On Track\" with buffer:**\n\n1. Celebrate the progress\n2. Suggest using buffer time for:\n   - More thorough literature review\n   - Additional experiments/features\n   - Earlier revision passes\n   - Building presentation materials\n3. Consider moving deadline internally earlier for stress reduction\n\n### Scenario: User needs to restructure thesis\n\n**When outline changes significantly:**\n\n1. Review `references/thesis_structure_template.md` together\n2. Create new chapter breakdown with page targets\n3. Regenerate timeline if deadline/pages changed\n4. Update weekly tasks to match new structure\n5. Adjust progress tracking baseline\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Generate timeline early:** Create the timeline at project start, even if approximate\n2. **Track weekly:** Run progress tracker every Friday to catch issues early\n3. **Be realistic:** Use actual available hours, account for other commitments\n4. **Update regularly:** Regenerate timeline when circumstances change\n5. **Break down tasks:** Convert abstract goals (\"write chapter 3\") into concrete daily tasks\n6. **Use templates:** Copy daily/weekly templates consistently for habit formation\n7. **Review structure:** Consult thesis structure template when planning each chapter\n8. **Buffer time:** Plan to finish 3-5 days before actual deadline for emergency buffer\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Timeline seems too aggressive:**\n- Reduce `--hours-per-day` to realistic value\n- Increase `--pages` estimate if current target too ambitious\n- Check if deadline is correct\n\n**Tasks not fitting in weekly schedule:**\n- Break tasks into smaller units\n- Prioritize and move non-essential tasks\n- Consider if scope is too large\n\n**Progress tracker showing unexpected status:**\n- Verify `--pages-completed` count is accurate\n- Check page counting methodology (full pages? half pages?)\n- Ensure deadline date is correct\n\n**Generated timeline has wrong phase names:**\n- Use `--phases` parameter to customize phase names\n- Order phases chronologically\n- Number of phases is flexible (3-5 recommended)\n\n## Resources Summary\n\n**Scripts:**\n- `scripts/generate_timeline.py` - Generate weekly timeline with workday calculations\n- `scripts/track_progress.py` - Calculate progress metrics and status assessment\n\n**References:**\n- `references/thesis_structure_template.md` - Complete CS thesis structure guide (50+ pages)\n- `references/weekly_checklist.md` - Weekly planning template with time management tips\n\n**Assets:**\n- `assets/daily_log_template.md` - Daily work log template for tracking daily progress\n\nAll scripts support `--help` flag for detailed usage information.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":85,"newStart":1,"newLines":341,"lines":[" ---"," name: bachelor-thesis-planner","-description: [TODO: Complete and informative explanation of what the skill does and when to use it.
