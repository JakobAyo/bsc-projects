I can see this is a workspace for creating and developing tools for Claude Code, including skills, subagents, and slash commands.\n\nI understand the key aspects of the project:\n\n- **Project Structure**: Skills go in `skills/`, agents in `agents/`, commands in `commands/`\n- **Creators Available**: skill-creator, subagent-creator, and slash-command-creator\n- **Git Workflow**: Must use the `git-workflow` skill for ALL git operations with Conventional Commits\n- **Workflow**: Create tools based on prompts, then package them as zip files\n\nI'm currently on the `root/slash-command-creator` branch. I can see there are some uncommitted changes:\n- Modified: `.claude/commands/project-init.md` and `commands/project-init.zip`\n- Deleted: `skills/bachelor-thesis-planner.zip`\n\nHow can I assist you today? Would you like me to:\n1. Create a new skill, subagent, or slash command?\n2. Help with git operations using the git-workflow?\n3. Review or modify existing tools?\n4.
