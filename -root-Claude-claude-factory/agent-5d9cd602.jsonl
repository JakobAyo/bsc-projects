I should use appropriate tools:\n   - Glob for broad file pattern matching\n   - Grep for searching file contents\n   - Read for specific file paths\n   - Bash only for read-only operations\n3. I should return absolute file paths in my final response\n4. The project is a Claude Factory workspace for creating skills, subagents, and hooks\n5.
