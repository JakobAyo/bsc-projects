The skill should:\n\n1. Trigger on markdown file creation\n2. Organize markdown files under the `docs` directory in appropriate subfolders\n3. Have enough categories for software engineering related docs\n\nBased on the example:\n- DevelopmentPlan.md -> /docs/plan\n- CodeReview.md -> /docs/review\n\nI need to:\n1. Create a skill that intercepts markdown file creation\n2. Determine the appropriate subfolder based on the file name/content\n3. Redirect the file to the correct location under docs/\n\nHowever, looking at the capabilities of skills in Claude Code, I should check the documentation first to understand how skills work and if they can intercept file creation events. Actually, from what I understand about Claude Code:\n\n- Skills are specialized prompts that provide domain knowledge and workflows\n- Hooks are executable scripts that automate workflows and can intercept events\n- The user is asking for something that \"triggers\" on file creation, which sounds more like a hook\n\nBut the user explicitly asked for a \"skill\". Let me think about this more carefully. Looking at the project instructions, it mentions:\n- Skills: Specialized workflows and domain knowledge that extend Claude's capabilities\n- Hooks: Executable scripts that automate workflows and integrate with development tools\n\nThe functionality the user wants (triggering on file creation) sounds more like a hook. However, they explicitly said \"skill\". \n\nI should clarify with the user, but actually, let me reconsider. A skill could be a workflow that instructs Claude to always organize markdown files in the docs directory. It would be a prompt/instruction set that Claude follows when creating markdown files.\n\nLet me create a skill that provides instructions for organizing markdown documentation. This would be invoked when the user wants to create markdown files, and it would guide Claude to organize them properly.\n\nActually, reading more carefully - the user says \"triggers everytime claude is trying to write a new Markdown file\" and \"should ALWAYS trigger on markdown files creation\". \n\nThe request seems to blur the lines between a skill and a hook. While the terminology suggests a hook's functionality, the user specifically wants a skill. I'll focus on creating a skill-based workflow that provides clear guidelines for markdown file organization, ensuring consistent placement and categorization of documentation files.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1015,"cache_read_input_tokens":19159,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1015,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":656,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV3pQf9UdXwgNaazATNGx","type":"assistant","uuid":"4fe96643-2a07-42c2-bbf9-b5a42b60e033","timestamp":"2025-11-12T10:13:58.618Z"}

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited*)\n\n*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n\nTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n2. When should the skill be used?\n3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3.

The skill should ensure that markdown files are always written under the `docs` directory in appropriate subfolders.\n\nThey gave examples:\n- DevelopmentPlan.md -> /docs/plan\n- CodeReview.md -> /docs/review\n\nAnd they want enough categories/subfolders for docs related to software engineering.\n\nLet me follow the Skill Creation Process:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nThe user has provided some examples already. I should think about what categories of software engineering documentation exist:\n\nCommon software engineering doc types:\n- Development Plans -> /docs/plan\n- Code Reviews -> /docs/review\n- Architecture documents -> /docs/architecture\n- API documentation -> /docs/api\n- Requirements -> /docs/requirements\n- Design documents -> /docs/design\n- Meeting notes -> /docs/meetings\n- Testing plans/results -> /docs/testing\n- Deployment guides -> /docs/deployment\n- Onboarding docs -> /docs/onboarding\n- Technical specs -> /docs/specs\n- Project proposals -> /docs/proposals\n- Retrospectives -> /docs/retrospectives\n- Changelogs -> /docs/changelog\n- Runbooks -> /docs/runbooks\n- Troubleshooting guides -> /docs/troubleshooting\n- Database schemas -> /docs/database\n- User guides -> /docs/guides\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nFor this skill, I need:\n- A mapping of common markdown file patterns to their appropriate subdirectories\n- Clear rules for categorization\n- A fallback for uncategorized files\n\nI could include:\n- `references/categories.md` - A reference file with the full list of categories and patterns\n- Or just include this information directly in SKILL.md since it's not that large\n\nI think this should be in SKILL.md itself since the categorization logic is core to the skill.\n\n\nI'll create a skill to automatically organize markdown documentation into a structured directory system. The skill will use intelligent pattern matching to route files to appropriate subdirectories within the `docs` folder. This approach ensures consistent documentation management and easy navigation for software engineering projects.\n\nThe key will be developing a flexible categorization system that can handle various document types while maintaining a clean, logical folder structure. I'll focus on creating clear, predictable routing rules that cover most software engineering documentation scenarios.\n\nI'll package the skill systematically and prepare for potential user feedback and iterative refinement. The goal is a robust, adaptable documentation organization tool that simplifies file management.","signature":"EpEVCkYICRgCKkAqdb7dnpOKDPX47MVvEodMqde4jAqpCJuLCeT/ctShC377lWjpdkW2zT7xLOXWwzDflhRnP9xhq5fnnWpdLJ9yEgyNQzD+Gy9wBKwygCYaDDscGF7rhi803bvi0yIwq9xJIBzMEXYgW8KYRxHaH3r8mIbzMZ8U47ekou9Ppv4R/eztSO7J7Xd6G3KWWNdGKvgTaqLTQX4bk1nXS7GqiXt3IU6BS4LwcLxHcz0by+wQVggQcaifFTXZMH5K3Gul31MzztOy+3MbB0SRX39jKAJBFrEwyjrG2ATOx3VtGAw2e7qohnkKfGs5rhk24DBITBVW/q1lPyUPfaRhimSda7AxADi9udAdptvC8XJYxf06pEfbiMBN3pC9i6wNga9OqCZJtHET7TEwYEPYblHY+wXzv8EZyQu8/5NQfw4PSE1XU+9dvP/B00LrMSa5QjV1N9GPjfpJzNxgCeNzzMVQGwOJE1PEWDqrujrfcHsunTHQx7KKKtBFZcVxQvWSuLrHZ4IvtUqjXPvz4fI/2ze7lU15RVfZPTgu5AM/JVN2m2+DC0bztdsiHt035djCFRhAR7tLCNUciS2fx+09Xre9iFa+dEiy82fYkFYK7jMEnOjUsNFZisFKjtXYANH8CmGNXM8JofeJvvmSqbAiUcg24CIch98JGesADKEmhkmxoK20zq574tm0jaoXW6j4qVLtBNDIk8QrjT1H4JlN4A1a8Yi8JdBJYh+3tA3hVQNnDVNjxUzr1iU5YZ7TAVsabSkG2BTpq1oPt/a7jWXOQAVu16vjGfGekAqoJ2Be7F6Dz5GyuYX6SthlDSPMuJbVDRAru0INPjzw+NNi4o15H7ToWct9N0QGL9fcWWioEqmqn/z3HH5/2ePvt71xtdIEkzryGF+MZWeaXxcuQCdCxjkJXzgetv6NG/s/Jl6cdLfeQ9+X/fbZ9ycXKPkwW0v4cYJL/tmN6N2zQjP4GulmOZMSXtEGBVh7dDtCUMwnl99c15pSgsQfLvuVW9EzeeYbRaErW3XWdUbXOJF8Ifl7DFe00X1jVZJSj0V3SDIRBD5Mimzq1ChCqaHSA7JS7QIteGMeYa50OD6OgPt8GFTheBucbuupl8VsnvmoXYHApdAFa8DtwG41Gp7wBfeROTl+2H7/TbjfPi9sxK/HFMDbG07+g0WACMOZ9oWXrONahwMjMr4P7bVM/00umFgrZrXYhFEALp4iuGf6uJ8EfHpx7208J5AC2XP+9t7c6szZ3jrNscC7TdVxmDksdHdCs7rkCR4F33IqKLazzfkBB9br3vM/88a9G78l7byKULFsFjwqyFv7KD1k6xeLxFp4/hOqO8MJFgesxoxEmi3n6Dk3cdAMD2aqZAB2NN7ye6PfhDn1v9aGE3Md4b0Vqy4QyRz65AGfWPhH4G0m25KZ0jMgnADlyRwOhYaPdmF32GuPNxGwRMsnlRdVP3Ej7gn/5er6C6Od0W2kypab1+W5Kma+DlQ/dZJbhAyYXII8TpW3jKU4K7Ezg15Cm+dOoVOz2YyP8RsWy7KmkneYuTaplYk5z66dOn01SBNHeg62TeKa1ROY1JqMtyl1PMt1C76UgzAJVwm7Xtul2K+fla6AR8cexDctp65FFpEBwlgN2A3La1o2kLvcCv8KV/Kex5yiOOGxrrXw41lWo/BPjZK9fn9snj27wftWbnUU/HKt7WudTdUaeflytqzCUhTQEchQdzXRT//RUrRmzsnt/hMEZDBkLRfQ84n6ro6SLT/YARiyo4o66GUcFp/9r17e3yPl3asTywmg+ffmSkfoSsPvUUo5h8fF00nRPjApNMIUjktGzI+RHVh5i5eEXNTZEanV6ivma6UKPgs6N02nMZ5Kkvg5zQ0uaLwkBovlP2yLsOILTcxvo2zfk7OMVpVdiZ6TG0f4gxWcFSTJB+f1CqdY7ES6yF9fmW9cuybQO5fVvhqI4P7JrYFwmYKC7JFMA9665fKCAIjI46IGATG1mip1sHwGiOtam0jg33heGyqdN72A5NpmTwgIA3PoenQWmlWbQdUI+jN4OoAq9NnKzUFboSfQFzYdL30JIE9inqAGB47nc2zy/5EdYwZpDr4oaaQOqUqK7WEU8s1UQ/+Bauv2uGHAWc90VU4G8r12E1dksz1t+ribqKFPzULonAf+lu2mDu4V87zM4ae/SBWCGTadAKn8swHfkXiGBXoSx574/5naoEVKtRC3W2pNVCe9U9VLm5m/o8J/MqDr8gWUZ0SMOgV7hwXR+jY+ru/RKbKvuYzHXA8QFsiMfnUtJQMPATr04kMRq2NdA0OacmytbY6eVyTn2xOtvRfZ8JU8aUxMmgCNOa+ZvnvTVmovBRnM4/bbCYPG8iXfxh6qQIM/pzd+qege9O7uOtbKXHz5H5F3EJmCAvNG+9KXmL5Jodw9v54nN8cs3rvPH/ooxtuEuCTS0jfja+tKYb9pUg+z/3/gkXzxEQMTaewQijRpk5DudG6WNsDKJXqt8r2OZliJ2DOf12CbE392Rxs9F5ZvH8FiV7jyp90hGAYV2kfYlZfZmVP5ZUp53zG7nEs5Tzd/0yXQYzVhK0o6HIh+ysH1/yCNzAWYBIhr8NmGr04mnbV2NsvHr6+2AIGr5jQFgc/E1SgLEkja9kxvAPoZwqde9RV0hXH54PZTZjbjmvfQtl7/2zoXNBh7gJiwlNfC3yjZJrZv0FqFZXkhTMx8gZnnOqYsq7kpWxPxHGDW68yLO4GEILhuqVXuHt0sE6nYR0vfmZUotBCFcHy850UEpOhJ2a77TWqlnALNpC85yKRCGur+rDLy6TEm9Q9Zk0AwFC0zWkyIh3Hx80FJn1Xy7taXqlZhesrZ6UC7g5r8IzhQ/ioFhcbL+c5MrPBW2e5QX8uvCoHeIFOYdpLlEpO3foBEHx+DCOgzWutgAxKCy0CqEPflGq3p6SH7F++PhJcDgFMvGROxp/dfzy7ejEgWwJbcr+CbC9m1u4EGZDGePmYigUaCDxTzvsduKwGld2ftlVmcaCTbzrHE3sv+AkD1vRfXe/GKqrzg36psTHcxNxGx9blAb0mvx4ujrbnx9hEIwdRmqKGz3DlzHYwPM+NkIzFS6WoQNUUKZdcER3wuwnfTC5bCbSP8cyFNhsjeac7erb6RO51rPZB5cAXhCc7hKRwOGJm4/6TyTri8UyJEDCT4XYQYJLCahPsSEP4OST6XIpMcjshjFYqSr0N4DjxElCcZrILHNIU+BfcHizGF9yIw7NSxZNWgpNleErhcCQdEReVgI7xsbLiuBk1M6jOHQK9DsCbATu9FA6ChR+H+dWwnrX3DSnNMFS54+iD0eCZGU5NofV+cvb8U+Pb6lyaGXGHYjBi45/4QYXKwdf+7TOU7XrlNpMt5PS9BrmPgfD8lE2tUMypboYIwLCHw+KyBlWmzSabm4hgXODEg3JolGMut9LKHdSDAKqhC75lNYUc/KPZR0LtSZBKAjzkX/7Oy3tWUzqrRQQl0aLQt2Jg/Ndh+TgRug/AuoZ199M/GxXmkV1ww/sZvXEIaMivQeE7sMgMXLxY9poY9IaxvxaoiQxCtjmozeCMviKZJRJPc/jr25DDocPjjVzsYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2691,"cache_read_input_tokens":20174,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2691,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":910,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV3pRyTKtRcpXCgTi2MVQ","type":"assistant","uuid":"03f3e023-f68d-4759-ad47-d375a9f9a36a","timestamp":"2025-11-12T10:14:18.759Z"}

Now I can see the template. Let me think about the categorization mapping for software engineering documentation.\n\nCommon categories I should support:\n1. plan - Development plans, project plans, roadmaps\n2. review - Code reviews, design reviews, PR reviews\n3. architecture - Architecture documents, system design, ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)\n4. api - API documentation, endpoint specs, OpenAPI docs\n5. requirements - Requirements documents, user stories, feature specs\n6. design - Design documents, UI/UX designs, technical designs\n7. meetings - Meeting notes, standup notes, retrospectives\n8. testing - Test plans, test results, QA documentation\n9. deployment - Deployment guides, release notes, runbooks\n10. onboarding - Onboarding docs, team handbooks\n11. specs - Technical specifications, protocol specs\n12. proposals - Project proposals, RFC documents\n13. changelog - Changelogs, version history\n14. troubleshooting - Troubleshooting guides, debugging docs\n15. database - Database schemas, migrations, ER diagrams\n16. guides - User guides, how-to guides, tutorials\n17. security - Security docs, threat models, security policies\n18. process - Process documents, workflows, SOPs\n19. reference - General reference materials, glossaries\n\nI should also have a fallback for uncategorized files - maybe just put them in /docs/general or /docs/misc.\n\nNow let me design the skill. Since this is about organizing files, I think a workflow-based approach would work well:\n1. Detect that a markdown file is being created\n2. Analyze the filename to determine the category\n3. Ensure the appropriate subdirectory exists\n4. Write the file to that location\n\nActually, looking at the user's request more carefully: \"It should ALWAYS trigger on markdown files creation\". This is interesting - skills typically trigger when invoked by name or when certain patterns are detected. But the user wants this to ALWAYS trigger.\n\nThis sounds more like a hook than a skill! Hooks can trigger on events like before/after tool calls. However, the user specifically asked for a skill, so I'll create a skill that should be invoked whenever Claude is about to write a markdown file.\n\n\nI'll draft precise instructions for implementing this markdown file organization skill, capturing the core workflow and categorization logic.","signature":"EsoSCkYICRgCKkDoNHno00M3FIup/bUCiGOZvw0KXrUkJx4TO9om0vDiDFpCwywGKc4HGkkOFjrjfFHCO8Vc4xcibh2vLhxHMFeFEgzWvs2lXALQGxCuHD4aDKH8d63nNOokafjI0iIwc3H2zr1cqAAGtDL0eaeqt+eIaea8xo7HcBdtxoHMvAEEqbpn+yEcWTRp9+f8u0EiKrERil/YUW0G2woHhFcMQpGIj08JBOjyKHi7ofxRwDgLsV28+qNy2xxEjNQj2HjQ2ComR06wOBuLZ75m35Wm5lXlgU3gm/nLyfuREHtjY8uqSaNpmA1jLT/VFlBE8Fr7aZYpt/fNCdUsg5vqcXyk3LQNW9ZCPXuBBk6j46V9bZSDo/djGn2dNH4AGQGUU9WJK9dFd9VZFxFjq11auNgzIeAb5hemHipwiWMit4oQxyXdNDptN6kPNVrL/k+2KMnHwzNa3Z+9DgOuKNL7kbnDMjQLoWm0dXdgr7AmFpEh36Xq0iJOpTU5ifJMSKRJAwtWd0am4pZ1Ua2F92/ldUZpfgcsIF3gOEWK0tQUk1MHf4nQJfd/5tX94YFpX00iVnJ97FJACdwIAV+uiTRhs8ok0hfI7AdefLQRzJMKDUDVjfd0Cot56LHurJaWy8uPc92ljbd1LD9LON4IPEzqCcId4LqkInIhkylTvvlgpolooavow/k9PG3l3PCzliG0Bl+ETNud+fyB1XSSjfDJa1CB3Al0IxHspre3KGaYwGNE0FitEm/LRsUttusVmkk+Sm53dPYWTOUlWWrRrpp1DEf6slgq3cSbKbrE3/4g2SgepNLxAhMXFQa1+4OulXBmNLfXtLHP7ylU+cEwiKEWTaVgQzgnqL/lq0bSd8kysmIpo7Dj4R3ZdHuM5un6OyojHfUlRvLz/Q6TIyNV/3HsASbz7G3mSeYlBfbNs7Z9isj7MwTImy3h9X70iJsHOImx+UlDdISZlOiYHJMSQYBu+7ls+TQCxe53/v/AIZHo8xcm8koYronqq33YhCpK5THHvy5UPIFbW6+g923Z72Hk2R0+iacBFVtPXAoRqkIJgS0naZGlYfd9Qy+Sw7F8kYPRX/RVriD64/xXegtBoIyJY5cAiW3T578pa8DS32GLjOhDsLVWIkDasb/1yCpNyZaEJLFhSKL/6uFX8YX0YKc2J8/9IdeRTmrLY0XJuTiqVG8nkT8d+6k7f873xEvXF8Mh67R+1ku0+u4uGUUHmPmqlITw6ZoQDqt9dSzRC1k5vOVcmmthQtk0RN5ZnksoN8HqCePM0TOtVUB4zGfpDz9j/u/HN8+zHL3wTelOSA3cFP714sU4HEkAMjGcQbnT377oMKSR4TLzQD+r2APUzemu0fudxQkN4NZ1oSxbs4VK4ICCNOtfE00/aPunTIzVZA/FgbalFhFsufYCrTUzqBXfbK2scC3lvkS1+i8At0/rf1kUjWI6HyfCaKFCRnOPuGwS6UkX3Sp+F2pXl6EDNLpi32TE1I4r6a4DW4qWKFeCTMnOU58LshexX0MwscYbaiQNaHcqdv/67piLjNijBZadXC+L0G10Qb3lODzxvnDpSC2erc4RwhRU8AiHSCF6znDnn3+eczfYiVSEiJQBCiIt2++k6Yr2A1O7w66rt3hmQFH0fqnt7ATDtECMGKtXSyEH+ws3vSRhxtHgOGrzc1Im72UF5s5WmocgaabSO/E8YrhDLrlv8eWiQhDCiNcEqe/y/KiR6HfJ+erLF/xAXRuks6P3RCsbsqVE9Izi8utpEX1eoVaRjKL/iFs0Q87Y2nk16p+LOE1Y9l3PXpwJoVvMcnUT6+R9T86WYzm2y1q3x//psuscdO/ieu7n0yGIKJBcPiP3T1s1mFi97YMcF7GT2w0iTI5rhf6PtEGjppd+KGf3Bezm3kvdIPKXjNvGcUhDtFGTs/BccDY1YqEHTviG47E+Tku2dDw7vsr/kAsD/eeL0JLJYBWslrg+as0cN5TjYxmJJRuEkCaZ78RFlH9Fn3XEvXGe+pwCedYXIpUmgICYQRSu5GxtKqguxZ8IDqb1xl0WelVWcz/LPtP0kwwS/dT/3FcYz2nkGy37B9Bi0p/EgZur24ZyRiUY9i4BkpGNliGi593uS6vmaH2rxcVI7+WaDNrVK00o0mXsynciDrrnbm6tc8a2q1d7m6oJ3+/9Z/KVpVmCKez26XhmtTi6LqXXTWpuDjaOvL0zI2lFpJc045BC4+GYHWgOrC1DaWeAmmj3Pz09P9uzHztEuzyIaxA03mj/ls9azW0pq/dCfV08ecfuEE3+QYv8My/P7RFnlYC6IMw6pYhTAJfAYaGXF5OsKtDhyK2v9DND5ihylu+Rzg63XSv/rLt1PaGE+A8XY+Kq59jEwrsJMW8R0MtT+belt6QoXDnlqGPbejV8IWpL4ipqUmVFTu5UWrF6e7chCENuJnEC7LAsGe5ZpqTkrgWvIynZTpHQXB2pfjDWiRgMkyVpWgI/7ds0eX6TeBWq/vqtoMcEg/cutwvLuTYV3dAE1zPeWNvM+nq5RdE5JWKJJxa2u9Kw/7P5Ts2ubOLWwSj4RTV/mcoQjdRmbc2XYPS4stPxqX9Tax7YRCsEfRupwl+TiipknaJUGIQ/g+hO5bK9WEjiAJtQ58RT5HyWqM+1JJ3kvM/wb4EnnluH3mYcAwJvCIkPHYOpc5Ho1OTug48nueJakQOZs7ft9v96QN4FQa2Nwthr4xheytbOjwcHV9uoPh3bQ5DnuPaGcXlawqgJ0F7yac22/2DWJpe/OFtEtYOLtznCUKVSFCMEgRS6Zwwl6NUlKZG6i613xi3BpOaCupwHbrdg62NE/HsJ0akY/+4MyaA5XPncZugtKVTVne0gdHImBgVAyuTPp6sMgiqFo8zNW1sk3deuBCaCj+qU1/Z/4sLi+bktXBVpKY0c9yevV9j6oA0dY7svyT6f57P7+IBYfScewtFDaHEdR9ltTXQ6Mj2ZLQ7aqR6sc/hHIdglJ2XHMRrMZ7tJKM49T6fZUFHbzXVE+z2d3Cw9frAHGFIOXDORTDesG0ncfE4wsQ1RjJ+V8VHdvRQNpMSQ7ClYw6GJOIyz4sr5cmKAFYfigQd9XMmy/EdVK41KQqQKwt/QhpIpnTMbdGZeAZiDdEhscCKAwxDX42mpwXCVArQRPq2F/qAYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":11,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1781,"cache_read_input_tokens":24454,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1781,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2630,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV3pUyB3SoDxmHGW4CzD6","type":"assistant","uuid":"1cf8f3a8-dbd3-4061-be4a-79d00e0ef8df","timestamp":"2025-11-12T10:14:56.295Z"}

It automatically organizes markdown files into appropriate subdirectories under the docs/ directory based on the file's purpose and content type, ensuring consistent documentation structure across software engineering projects.\n---\n\n# Docs Organizer\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill ensures that all markdown documentation files are systematically organized into appropriate subdirectories under the `docs/` directory. It analyzes the filename and intended content to determine the correct category, creates the necessary directory structure, and writes files to their proper location.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n**ALWAYS** use this skill before creating or writing any new markdown file (.md extension). This includes:\n- Development plans, roadmaps, and project documentation\n- Code reviews, design reviews, and technical assessments\n- Architecture documents, system designs, and ADRs\n- API documentation and specifications\n- Meeting notes, retrospectives, and team communications\n- Any other markdown documentation files\n\n**Exception:** Do not use this skill for:\n- README.md files in the project root or package directories\n- CHANGELOG.md files at the project root\n- LICENSE.md or CONTRIBUTING.md files at the project root\n- Markdown files that are part of application content (e.g., blog posts, user-facing content)\n\n## Documentation Categories\n\nOrganize markdown files into the following subdirectories under `docs/`:\n\n| Category | Directory | File Types |\n|----------|-----------|------------|\n| Development Plans | `docs/plan/` | DevelopmentPlan.md, ProjectPlan.md, Roadmap.md, Sprint*.md |\n| Code Reviews | `docs/review/` | CodeReview*.md, PullRequestReview*.md, DesignReview*.md |\n| Architecture | `docs/architecture/` | Architecture*.md, SystemDesign*.md, ADR*.md, TechStack*.md |\n| API Documentation | `docs/api/` | API*.md, Endpoints*.md, OpenAPI*.md, RestAPI*.md |\n| Requirements | `docs/requirements/` | Requirements*.md, UserStories*.md, FeatureSpec*.md, BRD*.md |\n| Technical Design | `docs/design/` | Design*.md, TechnicalDesign*.md, UIDesign*.md, DataModel*.md |\n| Meeting Notes | `docs/meetings/` | Meeting*.md, Standup*.md, Retrospective*.md, Notes*.md |\n| Testing | `docs/testing/` | TestPlan*.md, TestResults*.md, QA*.md, TestStrategy*.md |\n| Deployment | `docs/deployment/` | Deployment*.md, ReleaseNotes*.md, Runbook*.md, Operations*.md |\n| Onboarding | `docs/onboarding/` | Onboarding*.md, TeamHandbook*.md, GettingStarted*.md, Setup*.md |\n| Technical Specs | `docs/specs/` | Specification*.md, TechnicalSpec*.md, Protocol*.md, Standard*.md |\n| Proposals | `docs/proposals/` | Proposal*.md, RFC*.md, ProjectProposal*.md |\n| Changelog | `docs/changelog/` | CHANGELOG*.md, VersionHistory*.md, ReleaseHistory*.md |\n| Troubleshooting | `docs/troubleshooting/` | Troubleshooting*.md, Debug*.md, FAQ*.md, KnownIssues*.md |\n| Database | `docs/database/` | Schema*.md, Database*.md, Migration*.md, ERDiagram*.md |\n| Guides | `docs/guides/` | Guide*.md, HowTo*.md, Tutorial*.md, Walkthrough*.md |\n| Security | `docs/security/` | Security*.md, ThreatModel*.md, SecurityPolicy*.md, Audit*.md |\n| Process | `docs/process/` | Process*.md, Workflow*.md, SOP*.md, Procedure*.md |\n| General/Other | `docs/general/` | All uncategorized markdown files |\n\n## Workflow\n\nFollow these steps when creating any markdown file:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Filename and Purpose\n\nExamine the filename and intended content to determine which category best fits the document. Use pattern matching on the filename first, then consider the document's purpose if the filename is ambiguous.\n\n**Pattern Matching Rules:**\n- Match case-insensitively\n- Check for category keywords in the filename\n- If multiple categories match, use the most specific one\n- If no pattern matches, ask yourself: \"What is the primary purpose of this document?\"\n\n### 2. Determine the Target Directory\n\nBased on the categorization, construct the full path:\n```\ndocs/<category>/<filename>\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- `DevelopmentPlan.md` → `docs/plan/DevelopmentPlan.md`\n- `CodeReview.md` → `docs/review/CodeReview.md`\n- `APIEndpoints.md` → `docs/api/APIEndpoints.md`\n- `SecurityAudit2024.md` → `docs/security/SecurityAudit2024.md`\n\n### 3. Ensure Directory Structure Exists\n\nBefore writing the file, verify that the target directory exists. If it doesn't, create the full directory path including any intermediate directories.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p docs/<category>\n```\n\n### 4. Write the File\n\nWrite the markdown file to the determined location under the docs/ directory.\n\n## Category Selection Guidelines\n\nWhen the filename is ambiguous or doesn't match a clear pattern:\n\n**Ask these questions:**\n1. Is this about planning or roadmapping? → `docs/plan/`\n2. Is this a review of code, design, or architecture? → `docs/review/`\n3. Is this about system architecture or design decisions? → `docs/architecture/`\n4. Is this API or endpoint documentation? → `docs/api/`\n5. Is this about requirements or specifications? → `docs/requirements/` or `docs/specs/`\n6. Is this meeting notes or team communication? → `docs/meetings/`\n7. Is this about testing or QA? → `docs/testing/`\n8. Is this about deployment or operations? → `docs/deployment/`\n9. Is this a guide, tutorial, or how-to? → `docs/guides/`\n10. If none of the above apply → `docs/general/`\n\n**When in doubt:** Use `docs/general/` as the fallback category for any markdown file that doesn't clearly fit into another category.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Example 1: Creating a development plan**\n```\nUser request: \"Create a development plan for the new authentication feature\"\nFilename: DevelopmentPlan.md\nAnalysis: Contains \"Plan\" keyword → matches \"Development Plans\" category\nTarget: docs/plan/DevelopmentPlan.md\nAction: mkdir -p docs/plan && write file to docs/plan/DevelopmentPlan.md\n```\n\n**Example 2: Creating a code review**\n```\nUser request: \"Document the code review findings\"\nFilename: CodeReview.md\nAnalysis: Contains \"Review\" keyword → matches \"Code Reviews\" category\nTarget: docs/review/CodeReview.md\nAction: mkdir -p docs/review && write file to docs/review/CodeReview.md\n```\n\n**Example 3: Creating API documentation**\n```\nUser request: \"Document the REST API endpoints\"\nFilename: RestAPIEndpoints.md\nAnalysis: Contains \"API\" keyword → matches \"API Documentation\" category\nTarget: docs/api/RestAPIEndpoints.md\nAction: mkdir -p docs/api && write file to docs/api/RestAPIEndpoints.md\n```\n\n**Example 4: Creating an ambiguous document**\n```\nUser request: \"Create a document about our deployment strategy\"\nFilename: DeploymentStrategy.md\nAnalysis: Contains \"Deployment\" keyword → matches \"Deployment\" category\nTarget: docs/deployment/DeploymentStrategy.md\nAction: mkdir -p docs/deployment && write file to docs/deployment/DeploymentStrategy.md\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Always** check if the docs directory and appropriate subdirectory exist before writing\n- **Never** write markdown files to the project root or arbitrary locations (except for standard files like README.md, CHANGELOG.md in root)\n- **Always** preserve the original filename when moving to the categorized location\n- If uncertain about categorization, default to `docs/general/` rather than making an incorrect guess\n- This organization applies to **new** markdown files only; do not automatically move existing markdown files without explicit user request\n"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":11,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1781,"cache_read_input_tokens":24454,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1781,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2630,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV3pUyB3SoDxmHGW4CzD6","type":"assistant","uuid":"e9543daf-bab3-4037-acb5-7c8ffbf35d02","timestamp":"2025-11-12T10:15:26.612Z"}

It automatically organizes markdown files into appropriate subdirectories under the docs/ directory based on the file's purpose and content type, ensuring consistent documentation structure across software engineering projects.\n---\n\n# Docs Organizer\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill ensures that all markdown documentation files are systematically organized into appropriate subdirectories under the `docs/` directory. It analyzes the filename and intended content to determine the correct category, creates the necessary directory structure, and writes files to their proper location.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n**ALWAYS** use this skill before creating or writing any new markdown file (.md extension). This includes:\n- Development plans, roadmaps, and project documentation\n- Code reviews, design reviews, and technical assessments\n- Architecture documents, system designs, and ADRs\n- API documentation and specifications\n- Meeting notes, retrospectives, and team communications\n- Any other markdown documentation files\n\n**Exception:** Do not use this skill for:\n- README.md files in the project root or package directories\n- CHANGELOG.md files at the project root\n- LICENSE.md or CONTRIBUTING.md files at the project root\n- Markdown files that are part of application content (e.g., blog posts, user-facing content)\n\n## Documentation Categories\n\nOrganize markdown files into the following subdirectories under `docs/`:\n\n| Category | Directory | File Types |\n|----------|-----------|------------|\n| Development Plans | `docs/plan/` | DevelopmentPlan.md, ProjectPlan.md, Roadmap.md, Sprint*.md |\n| Code Reviews | `docs/review/` | CodeReview*.md, PullRequestReview*.md, DesignReview*.md |\n| Architecture | `docs/architecture/` | Architecture*.md, SystemDesign*.md, ADR*.md, TechStack*.md |\n| API Documentation | `docs/api/` | API*.md, Endpoints*.md, OpenAPI*.md, RestAPI*.md |\n| Requirements | `docs/requirements/` | Requirements*.md, UserStories*.md, FeatureSpec*.md, BRD*.md |\n| Technical Design | `docs/design/` | Design*.md, TechnicalDesign*.md, UIDesign*.md, DataModel*.md |\n| Meeting Notes | `docs/meetings/` | Meeting*.md, Standup*.md, Retrospective*.md, Notes*.md |\n| Testing | `docs/testing/` | TestPlan*.md, TestResults*.md, QA*.md, TestStrategy*.md |\n| Deployment | `docs/deployment/` | Deployment*.md, ReleaseNotes*.md, Runbook*.md, Operations*.md |\n| Onboarding | `docs/onboarding/` | Onboarding*.md, TeamHandbook*.md, GettingStarted*.md, Setup*.md |\n| Technical Specs | `docs/specs/` | Specification*.md, TechnicalSpec*.md, Protocol*.md, Standard*.md |\n| Proposals | `docs/proposals/` | Proposal*.md, RFC*.md, ProjectProposal*.md |\n| Changelog | `docs/changelog/` | CHANGELOG*.md, VersionHistory*.md, ReleaseHistory*.md |\n| Troubleshooting | `docs/troubleshooting/` | Troubleshooting*.md, Debug*.md, FAQ*.md, KnownIssues*.md |\n| Database | `docs/database/` | Schema*.md, Database*.md, Migration*.md, ERDiagram*.md |\n| Guides | `docs/guides/` | Guide*.md, HowTo*.md, Tutorial*.md, Walkthrough*.md |\n| Security | `docs/security/` | Security*.md, ThreatModel*.md, SecurityPolicy*.md, Audit*.md |\n| Process | `docs/process/` | Process*.md, Workflow*.md, SOP*.md, Procedure*.md |\n| General/Other | `docs/general/` | All uncategorized markdown files |\n\n## Workflow\n\nFollow these steps when creating any markdown file:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Filename and Purpose\n\nExamine the filename and intended content to determine which category best fits the document. Use pattern matching on the filename first, then consider the document's purpose if the filename is ambiguous.\n\n**Pattern Matching Rules:**\n- Match case-insensitively\n- Check for category keywords in the filename\n- If multiple categories match, use the most specific one\n- If no pattern matches, ask yourself: \"What is the primary purpose of this document?\"\n\n### 2. Determine the Target Directory\n\nBased on the categorization, construct the full path:\n```\ndocs/<category>/<filename>\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- `DevelopmentPlan.md` → `docs/plan/DevelopmentPlan.md`\n- `CodeReview.md` → `docs/review/CodeReview.md`\n- `APIEndpoints.md` → `docs/api/APIEndpoints.md`\n- `SecurityAudit2024.md` → `docs/security/SecurityAudit2024.md`\n\n### 3. Ensure Directory Structure Exists\n\nBefore writing the file, verify that the target directory exists. If it doesn't, create the full directory path including any intermediate directories.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p docs/<category>\n```\n\n### 4. Write the File\n\nWrite the markdown file to the determined location under the docs/ directory.\n\n## Category Selection Guidelines\n\nWhen the filename is ambiguous or doesn't match a clear pattern:\n\n**Ask these questions:**\n1. Is this about planning or roadmapping? → `docs/plan/`\n2. Is this a review of code, design, or architecture? → `docs/review/`\n3. Is this about system architecture or design decisions? → `docs/architecture/`\n4. Is this API or endpoint documentation? → `docs/api/`\n5. Is this about requirements or specifications? → `docs/requirements/` or `docs/specs/`\n6. Is this meeting notes or team communication? → `docs/meetings/`\n7. Is this about testing or QA? → `docs/testing/`\n8. Is this about deployment or operations? → `docs/deployment/`\n9. Is this a guide, tutorial, or how-to? → `docs/guides/`\n10. If none of the above apply → `docs/general/`\n\n**When in doubt:** Use `docs/general/` as the fallback category for any markdown file that doesn't clearly fit into another category.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Example 1: Creating a development plan**\n```\nUser request: \"Create a development plan for the new authentication feature\"\nFilename: DevelopmentPlan.md\nAnalysis: Contains \"Plan\" keyword → matches \"Development Plans\" category\nTarget: docs/plan/DevelopmentPlan.md\nAction: mkdir -p docs/plan && write file to docs/plan/DevelopmentPlan.md\n```\n\n**Example 2: Creating a code review**\n```\nUser request: \"Document the code review findings\"\nFilename: CodeReview.md\nAnalysis: Contains \"Review\" keyword → matches \"Code Reviews\" category\nTarget: docs/review/CodeReview.md\nAction: mkdir -p docs/review && write file to docs/review/CodeReview.md\n```\n\n**Example 3: Creating API documentation**\n```\nUser request: \"Document the REST API endpoints\"\nFilename: RestAPIEndpoints.md\nAnalysis: Contains \"API\" keyword → matches \"API Documentation\" category\nTarget: docs/api/RestAPIEndpoints.md\nAction: mkdir -p docs/api && write file to docs/api/RestAPIEndpoints.md\n```\n\n**Example 4: Creating an ambiguous document**\n```\nUser request: \"Create a document about our deployment strategy\"\nFilename: DeploymentStrategy.md\nAnalysis: Contains \"Deployment\" keyword → matches \"Deployment\" category\nTarget: docs/deployment/DeploymentStrategy.md\nAction: mkdir -p docs/deployment && write file to docs/deployment/DeploymentStrategy.md\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Always** check if the docs directory and appropriate subdirectory exist before writing\n- **Never** write markdown files to the project root or arbitrary locations (except for standard files like README.md, CHANGELOG.md in root)\n- **Always** preserve the original filename when moving to the categorized location\n- If uncertain about categorization, default to `docs/general/` rather than making an incorrect guess\n- This organization applies to **new** markdown files only; do not automatically move existing markdown files without explicit user request\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":85,"newStart":1,"newLines":155,"lines":[" ---"," name: docs-organizer","-description: [TODO: Complete and informative explanation of what the skill does and when to use it.
