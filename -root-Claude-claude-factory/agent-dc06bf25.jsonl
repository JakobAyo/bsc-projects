Key directories are:\n   - `skills/` for Skills\n   - `agents/` for Subagents\n   - `commands/` for Slash-commands\n5. Git operations should use the `git-workflow` skill\n\nI'm equipped with tools to:\n- Use Glob for file pattern matching\n- Use Grep for content searching with regex\n- Use Read for examining specific files\n- Use Bash for read-only operations only\n\nI'm prepared to thoroughly explore the codebase and help you find what you need.
